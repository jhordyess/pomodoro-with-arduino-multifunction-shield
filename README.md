# Pomodoro timer with Arduino Multifunction Shield

Simple Pomodoro timer with Arduino Multifunction Shield.

## Features

Two main modes:

- Manual -> It starts a Pomodoro or a break with the button.
- Auto-loop -> It starts a Pomodoro or a break automatically (to reset it is necessary to pause).

Default minutes:

- A short break has 5 minutes.
- A long break has 15 minutes.
