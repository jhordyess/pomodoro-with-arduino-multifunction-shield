### Hardware

To build this device, the following items are required:

- Arduino microcontroller (Arduino UNO R3 was used)
- Arduino Multifunction Shield (for Arduino Uno R3)

### Software

This project requires the following libraries to run:

- [Multi Function Shield Library by Hpsaturn](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/hpsaturn/MultiFuncShield)

### Developer Notes

- Developed using [Visual Studio Code with development containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)(optional). With custom [devcontainer](https://gist.github.com/jhordyess/07f126d2017bb99bcfca9cffc62162bc) configuration file.
- Developed using the [PlatformIO extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide).
- If you are running in Linux, you could also need the correct permission ```sudo chmod o+rw /dev/ttyACM0```.

## To-Do

- Choose the number of Pomodoros to make.
- Disable auto-loop on pause.
- Change the default minutes before playing.
